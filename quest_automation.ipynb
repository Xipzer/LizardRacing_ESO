    "# (ESO) Quest Automation: Lizard Racing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides functionality to automate the Lizard Racing (repeatable) Daily Quest - located in Reaper's March.\n",
    "\n",
    "The automation code utilizes image recognition to interpret the state of the quest and interact with the quest NPC, accordingly. These images, and their coordinates, are dependent on your individual system. I have provided files and coordinates based on the game being run on a 1920x1080 system at 100% windows scaling, with the game running fullscreen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The automation uses character movement to attempt timeout prevention - this does not always work - and assumes you are sandwiched between the crucible beside the NPC, facing towards the NPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the automation to startup properly, you must not already be on the quest - whether failed or completed. I.E. Start with the NPC displaying a blue tracker icon above their head.\n",
